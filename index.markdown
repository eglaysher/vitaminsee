VitaminSEE is an image viewer for OSX that focuses on interface responsiveness
and speed. It offers a clean interface and fast load times. VitaminSEE will
automatically thumbnail your images, optionally saving them with the files.

<!-- Place this tag where you want the +1 button to render -->
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
  <div class="g-plusone" data-size="tall" data-count="true">
  </div>
</div>

VitaminSEE has been tested on OS X, 10.4. It has been superficially tested
under 10.5. I've abandoned the project since OSX is no longer my <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com">primary operating system</a>. Anyone who wishes to
fork VitaminSEE to port it to Apple's newest operating system does so with my
blessing: the code is available under the GNU GPLv2.

Version 0.7.2 will probably be the last version released by me, unless I
uncharacteristically start liking proprietary operating systems again.

### Features
- VitaminSEE is quick. I've strived to make this the fastest image viewer
  available for the Mac.
- VitaminSEE automatically thumbnails your images. These thumbnails are used
  not only by VitaminSEE, but also by the Finder.
- VitaminSEE allows you to quickly organize your pictures into different
  directories with it's integrated Sort Manager.
- VitaminSEE allows you to tag your pictures with keywords.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so how about some <a

### Awards

VitaminSEE was first written for a contest at the <a
href="http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a> called the Cocoa
Codeoff. VitaminSEE won the Best Application award. The Cocoa Codeoff page has
died, replaced with the <a

iWeb 06.
