VitaminSEE is an image viewer for OSX that focuses on interface responsiveness
and speed. It offers a clean interface and fast load times. VitaminSEE will
automatically thumbnail your images, optionally saving them with the files.

VitaminSEE has been tested on OS X, 10.4. It has been superficially tested
under 10.5. I've abandoned the project since OSX is no longer my <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com">primary operating system</a>. Anyone who wishes to
fork VitaminSEE to port it to Apple's newest operating system does so with my
blessing: the code is available under the GNU GPLv2.

Version 0.7.2 will probably be the last version released by me, unless I
uncharacteristically start liking proprietary operating systems again.

### Features
- VitaminSEE is quick. I've strived to make this the fastest image viewer
  available for the Mac.
- VitaminSEE automatically thumbnails your images. These thumbnails are used
  not only by VitaminSEE, but also by the Finder.
- VitaminSEE allows you to quickly organize your pictures into different
  directories with it's integrated Sort Manager.
- VitaminSEE allows you to tag your pictures with keywords.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so how about some <a

### Awards

VitaminSEE was first written for a contest at the <a
href="http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a> called the Cocoa
Codeoff. VitaminSEE won the Best Application award. The Cocoa Codeoff page has
died, replaced with the <a

iWeb 06.
