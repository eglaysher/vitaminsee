0.7 Final Release (February 20th, 2006)
-------------------------
* Add "Enclosing Folder" and "Go to Folder..." toolbar items.
* Fix Delete toolbar item
* Fix the Help menu
* Build both a Universal Binary, and an unsupported Panther build. (The Panther
  build has a few cosmetic bugs that WONTFIX.)

0.7-Beta Release (February 8th, 2006)
-------------------------------------
* Move to a multi-window interface. This required a substantial refactoring/
  rewrite of the core of VitaminSEE. The new organization should allow me to
  add features quicker.
* UI is more responsive while:
  * Scrolling through very large images (2000x2000 or greater)
  * Moving, copying and renaming files
* VitaminSEE windows now zoom properly, and should no longer overlap with the
  Dock.
* Monitor the filesystem for changes so there's no longer a reason to reload.
  (Buzzword: kqueue)
* Renaming a file has been moved off the Keywords window (which doesn't make
  any sense), and is now an option on the File menu.
* Fix Keywords, so the creation date of a file isn't lost when you modify the
  keywords.
* Universal binary release.

0.6.4.2 Bugfix Release (August 28th, 2005)
------------------------------------------
* Fix crash by memory exhaustion in the "Add Thumbnail" Automator action.
  (Thanks to Sergiu Partenie for the bug report.)

0.6.4.1 Emergency Bugfix Release (July 13th, 2005)
--------------------------------------------------
* Fix crashing in thumbnailing code.

0.6.4 Release (July 5th, 2005)
------------------------------
* You can now generate thumbnails, but not store them on disk. (The default
  behavior is to write thumbnails to disk because of RAM consumption.)
* Massivly reduce RAM consumption when building thumbnails
* Bug fix: Program could get stuck on "Loading..." if computer was never
  named. (Kudos to "L S" for the bug report.)
* Move Gemmell's prefs controller code into it's own bundle.
* Automator actions:
  * Set desktop background folder
  * Add thumbnail Icon
  * Remove thumbnail Icon
* The Tiger GIF loader isn't as resiliant against broken animated GIFs as
  the Panther one was. Add a workaround that fixes *some* animated GIFs
  that work under Panther. These images will play slowly, but at least 
  they'll play.

0.6.3 Release (May 31st, 2005)
------------------------------
* Support all file types that the underlying OS says we can open. This includes
  PDFs, Photoshop images, and (theoretically) some camera RAW formats.
* Small speed enhancements most people won't notice
* Set as Desktop Picture/Use Folder For Desktop Pictures: Set the current image
  as the desktop background picture or the contents of the currently selected 
  folder for random backgrounds.
* Translation fixes and AppleHelp translation by Hiroto Sakai

0.6.2 Bugfix Release (May 20th, 2005)
-------------------------------------
* The Favorites toolbar item now correctly has a menu when in "Text Only" mode 
  and in overflow mode.
* Fixed few places where UNIX paths were still being displayed to the user.
* Added an open with menu.
* Fixed behavior when handling symlinks; the directory drop down no longer gets
  screwed up when following a symlink.
* Use localized display name for the default Favorites location.
* Unicode keywords are now handled properly
* Rough Japanese translation. There may be grammar errors here and there; I want
  to know about them. Props to the Japanese translation for Apple Preview and 
  gqview for giving me a vocabulary lesson...
* Don't smooth the image at Actual Size; it doesn't do anything except slow 
  things down. Apply smoothing only when shrinking or enlarging the image.
* In the same vein, don't smooth the image when the unzoomed image will fit in 
  the viewing area.
* Handle unmounting in a sane way.

0.6.1 Release (May 13th, 2005)
------------------------------
* Present the filesystem to the user like the Mac filesystem, not the Unix filesystem.
  (Use Machintosh HD:Users:name:... instead of /Users/name/ style paths.)
* Disable show/hide toolbar and customize toolbar when window isn't displayed...
* Autosave main window position
* Disable buttons in sort manager when you close VS window and then open sort 
  manager.
* Adding a thumbnail doesn't change a file's modification time (which makes
  more sense since we aren't really modifying the file; just adding a piece of
  metadata on the filesystem).
* Option to show hidden files; we now hide stuff at the @"/" level by default.
* Advanced preference pane
* Fix problem where thumbnails on remote servers weren't being displayed after
  they were generated
* Some memory leaks were fixed.
* Now use RBSplitView to prevent that stupid crash that I reported last version.
* Because of RBSplitView, there is a "Show/Hide File List" option in the View menu.
* Tabbing between controls now works; Up/Down in the file list changes
* Added Next/Previous items to the Go menu for navigation when the file list is
  hidden.
* Use UTI types on 10.4.

0.6 Release (April 29th, 2005)
------------------------------
* A couple of speed fixes:
  * Entering a new directory is much faster. On my computer, entering a
    directory of 746 images took 5 seconds in 0.5.3. Now it takes less then
	a second.
  * Cut application startup time by a small amount.
  * More intelligent preloading behavior makes things "feel" faster.
  * Tiger fixes a problem with the AppKit that was causing me to do more 
    redraws then was neccessary. Slightly faster on Tiger (you'll notice it 
	only if you scroll through your files on a low memory machine).
* ICNS and Windows Bitmap (BMP) support.
* Stop assuming people have a "~/Pictures" folder. Some people have broken
  out of Apple's default hiearchy and we shouldn't make assumptions.
* Finally get rid of that annoying graphical glitch where thumbnails aren't
  drawn in certain circumstances.
* When an image won't fit in the viewing area, the user can now drag the
  image around with a hand cursor like they can in Preview.
* Change "Sort Manager" preferences to "Favorites." These paths are now
  used both in the Sort Manager and in the new "Favorite Locations" menu in 
  the "Go" menu and its corresponding toolbar item.
* Files with the wrong extension (JPEG files ending in GIF, PNG files
  ending in JPEG) are loaded, instead of raising an error.
* Move, Copy and Rename operations now check if they are overwriting a file
  and warn the user. 
* Move, Copy and Rename are now undoable. Undo for delete isn't implemented 
  yet. (I'm having problems figuring out the trash system, but I'll get it
  eventually).

0.5.3 Feature Release (April 5th, 2005)
---------------------------------------
* Changed the SortManager so that the NSTableView takes up the entire window, 
  and also, made it resizable. I was testing it the other day and the lack of 
  resizing screwed things up.
* Allow drag and drop reordering in the Sort Manager Preferences.
* Ability to disable Preloading Images.
* Update help to reflect new Preload Images option.
* Credits.rtf -> Credits.html. Now with links instead of URLs!

0.5.2 Feature Release (March 26th, 2005)
----------------------------------------
* You can now drag image files and folders to the VitaminSEE icon. I've
  registered VitaminSEE as a handler for folders, JPEGS, GIFs and TIFFs. Now
  all I need to do if figure out how to reigster with the Finder's "Open 
  With..." menu...

0.5.1 Bugfix Release (March 22nd, 2005)
---------------------------------------
* Fixed displaying of wrong filesize on files over 1 Megabyte.
* Fixed CRITICAL memory leak in thumbnailing code that was causing the program
  to crash.

0.5 Final (March 20th, 2005)
----------------------------
* Cosmetic changes (HIG compliance)
* Add a "Known Issues" page to the help
* Make the GPL a Help menu item

0.5 Release Canidate 2 (March 20th, 2005)
-----------------------------------------
* Fixed deadlock that would occur every half hour or so.
